				<p class="textkanan">Aquariums, botanical gardens, national parks and nature reserves. Research holiday destinations and countries that work hard to protect wildlife and habitats.
				</p>
				<p class="textkanan">By not purchasing products made from illegally sourced protected wildlife or their parts and products, you can stop wildlife trafficking from being a profitable enterprise. More information can be found through your national or local wildlife authorities or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species or Wild fauna and Flora (CITES).

				</p>
				<p class="textkanan">Learn more about our planet’s flora and fauna, including those that are in danger of extinction. Research ways that you or your community can conserve and protect wildlife. Inform yourself on current environmental matters and be aware of your individual impact on ecosystems and wildlife. Think globally, act locally.
				</p>
				<p class="textkanan">Share your knowledge, passion and questions about wildlife conservation with your friends, family and community – either in person or online.
				</p>
				<p class="textkanan">Inform authorities if you have information on illegal logging, fishing and wildlife trafficking; whistle-blowers play a critical role in detecting wildlife crimes and holding criminal smugglers accountable.
